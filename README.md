ðŸŽµ Music Player Web App | HTML â€¢ CSS â€¢ JavaScript

This is a simple yet elegant music player web application I built in 2023, right after completing my 12th grade. As one of my first hands-on projects while diving into the world of web development, this app helped me understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ’¡ Features:

Clean and responsive user interface

Play, pause, skip, and seek functionalities

Interactive progress bar and dynamic song details

Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS â€” no frameworks

ðŸŒ± What I Learned:

Structuring a web page using semantic HTML

Styling with modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, transitions, etc.)

DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript

Building a complete UI from scratch

ðŸ”§ Status: Complete (Beginner-level project)

This project marks the beginning of my journey as a web developer. Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements!
